# Design patterns

Just a collection of my own implementations of some design patterns. I'm no expert in this domain, just trying to apply what I learn and read to more concrete examples, maybe at some point experiment with different languages and keep a library of implementations to refer to.


## Implemented

### Creational patterns

* Object pool / resource pool
* Singleton


### Behavioral patterns

* Chain of responsibility
* Command
